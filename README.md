# SI-GuidedProject-454064-1679639084
URL-Based Phishing Detection using machine learning


Project Objective:

* You’ll be able to understand the problem to classify if it is a regression or a classification kind of problem.
* You will be able to know how to pre-process/clean the data using different data pre-processing techniques.
* Applying different algorithms according to the dataset
* You will be able to know how to find the accuracy of the model.
* You will be able to build web applications using the Flask framework.


Project Flow:

1.Download the dataset.
2.Preprocess or clean the data.
3.Analyze the pre-processed data.
4.Train the machine with preprocessed data using an appropriate machine learning algorithm.
5.Save the model and its dependencies.
6.Build a Web application using a flask that integrates with the model built.

Pre-Requisites:

Step 1: Install Anaconda Navigator
Step 2: Open Command Prompt and 
Type “pip install numpy” and click enter.
Type “pip install pandas” and click enter.
Type “pip install matplotlib” and click enter.
Type “pip install scikit-learn” and click enter.
Type “pip install Flask” and click enter.
If you are using Pycharm IDE, you can install the packages through the command prompt and follow the same syntax as above.
